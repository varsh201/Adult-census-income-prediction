A machine learning web application that predicts whether a person's income exceeds $50K/year based on U.S. Census data.

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates:
- End-to-end machine learning workflow
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Random Forest classification model
- Interactive web interface with Streamlit
- Model deployment

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface to input demographic parameters
- **Data Exploration**: Visualize dataset statistics and distributions
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate a Random Forest classifier
- **Income Prediction**: Get instant predictions with probability scores
- **Educational Tool**: Great for learning ML deployment concepts

## 📊 Dataset

The **Adult Census Income** dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository contains:
- 48,842 instances
- 14 demographic features
- Binary classification target (>50K or ≤50K)

Features include:
- Age, workclass, education
- Occupation, marital status
- Race, gender, hours-per-week
- Native country, capital gains/losses

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adult-income-prediction.git
cd adult-income-prediction
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser with 4 main pages:
1. **Introduction**: Project overview
